___

## Features:
All of the Forsaken Powers are now passive effects that don't expire.

By default, only the currently selected Power will be active, and can be changed the same way as normal - by visiting the standing stones at the spawn point and interacting with a different Forsaken trophy. This behavior can be altered in the config file:
Disabling the OnlyOnePower setting will allow you to have all of your currently acquired Powers active at once.
Enabling AllPowers will override the other settings and have every Forsaken Power effect active regardless of your power selection or character/world progression.

**This is a Client-Side BepInEx mod.**

## Dependencies
[BepInEx](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/)

## Installation:
Install via Vortex, or by extracting PassiveForsakenPowers.dll into your BepInEx plugins directory.
